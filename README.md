-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a ViZDoom starter project for Windows users with Microsoft Visual Studio (2015).

Everything works out of the box.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

ViZDoom allows developing AI **bots that play Doom using only the visual information** (the screen buffer). 
It is primarily intended for research in machine visual learning, and deep reinforcement learning, in particular.

ViZDoom is based on [ZDoom](https://github.com/rheit/zdoom) to provide the game mechanics.

ViZDoom API is **reinforcement learning** friendly (suitable also for learning from demonstration, apprenticeship learning or apprenticeship via inverse reinforcement learning, etc.).
